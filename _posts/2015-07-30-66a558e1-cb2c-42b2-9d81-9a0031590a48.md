i am feeling frustrated. i can't pick a color palette. can't find where it all started. it's annoying this is not easy and the things it is doing are NOT good design. ugh. hopefully it's because it is beta but it's really hard to figure out. and looks like crap. i do NOT want a white background i'd like a nice photo back there but i can't pick and as a designer it just is frustrating. i am logging this because i think it's important for the team to hear how a user is feeling on their first try. i dont even know where to put my LOGO!!! it's not very easy so far.
